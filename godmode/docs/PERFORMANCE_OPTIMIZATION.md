# God Mode Performance Optimization

## Overview

This document outlines performance optimization strategies for the God Mode functionality, focusing on cache synchronization, data export, and webhook processing.

## Cache Synchronization

### Current Performance

- Cache synchronization can be resource-intensive, especially for large datasets
- Timestamp comparison helps avoid unnecessary updates
- Batch processing is used for large operations

### Bottlenecks

1. **Full Synchronization**: Syncing all models at once can be resource-intensive
2. **Missing Timestamps**: Without timestamps, unnecessary syncs may occur
3. **Large Objects**: Syncing large objects can consume significant memory
4. **Database Locks**: Frequent updates can cause database contention

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Selective Synchronization**:
   - Prioritize frequently accessed models
   - Implement a schedule for different models
   - Allow manual selection of critical models

2. **Timestamp Management**:
   - Ensure all cached objects have timestamps
   - Use consistent timestamp fields across models
   - Add timestamps during cache operations

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process keys in smaller batches
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add progress tracking for long-running operations

4. **Database Optimization**:
   - Use database transactions efficiently
   - Minimize lock duration
   - Consider using bulk operations where possible

5. **Caching Improvements**:
   - Implement cache warming for frequently accessed data
   - Use cache hierarchies for related data
   - Implement cache eviction policies

### Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term**:
   - Add timestamps to all cache operations
   - Implement batch processing for large operations
   - Add progress tracking for long-running operations

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Implement selective synchronization
   - Optimize database operations
   - Enhance monitoring and metrics

## Data Export

### Current Performance

### Bottlenecks

1. **Webhook Volume**: High volume of webhooks can overwhelm the system
2. **Synchronous Processing**: Processing webhooks synchronously can cause delays
3. **Database Operations**: Each webhook may require multiple database operations
4. **Error Handling**: Handling webhook errors can be resource-intensive

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Process webhooks asynchronously
   - Implement a queue for webhook processing
   - Use worker processes for processing

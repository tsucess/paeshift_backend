## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- Implementing a more sophisticated LRU algorithm
- Adding more geocoding providers
- Implementing a circuit breaker pattern for provider failures
- Adding geographic region-based provider selection
- Implementing batch geocoding for multiple addresses
## 5. Monitoring System

A new monitoring system has been implemented with:

- Admin-only monitoring endpoints
- Detailed cache statistics
- Geocoding performance metrics
- Test endpoint for geocoding
- Cache clearing functionality
- Recent operation history

### Monitoring Endpoints

- `/jobs/monitoring/geocoding-stats/` - View detailed geocoding statistics
- `/jobs/monitoring/clear-cache/` - Clear the geocoding cache
- `/jobs/monitoring/test-geocoding/?address=123+Main+St` - Test geocoding with different addresses

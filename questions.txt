What should happen if a job is posted for 5 applicants, but only 2 applicants are selected and the job date passes (job is now closed)?

Should the job be automatically marked as "closed" or "incomplete"?
Should the client be notified that the job was not fully staffed?
Should the remaining open positions be re-posted or archived?
Should the 2 selected applicants still be paid and marked as completed, or does the job require all 5 to proceed?
How do you handle payments and refunds in this scenario?

If the client prepaid for 5 applicants but only 2 worked, is there an automatic refund or credit for the unfilled positions?
How is the payment status updated for partially filled jobs?
What notifications or follow-up actions should occur?

Should the client receive a summary or feedback request after the job date?
Should applicants who were not selected or not assigned be notified?
How is job status tracked in your system?

Do you have statuses like "partially filled", "completed", "expired", or "cancelled"?
Should jobs with unfilled positions be flagged for admin review?
